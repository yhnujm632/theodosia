# Theodosia
A Python Tkinter app. It lets the user browse news, only requiring audio as input to work, making it ideal as a visually impaired accomodation.

*The folder names "piper" is NOT my own work. It is the folder containing the piper.exe file. Piper is the library I use to stream text to audio. You can find the source code to the piper.exe file here: https://github.com/rhasspy/piper*
