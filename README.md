A Python Tkinter app. It lets the user browse news, only requiring audio as input to work, making it ideal as a visually impaired accomodation.

**The folder named "piper" is NOT my own work - it's a library that I use that is saved locally. It is the folder containing the piper.exe file. Piper is the library I use to stream text to audio. You can find the source code to the piper.exe file here: https://github.com/rhasspy/piper**
